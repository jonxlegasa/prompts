# prompts

A collection of AI prompts — system instructions, mission statements, and reusable skills — with a stow-based deployment system for tools that need them.

## What this is

A place to collect and manage prompts: system prompts, interesting mission statements, reusable skills/commands, and anything else worth keeping. Some are actively deployed to AI tools, others are just saved for reference.

The deployment side uses GNU Stow to symlink prompts into the right locations for each tool. Currently supports Claude Code and OpenCode, but the system is tool-agnostic — add a stow package for any tool.

| Source | Claude Code target | OpenCode target |
|---|---|---|
| `src/MISSION.md` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` |
| `src/skills/*.md` | `~/.claude/commands/*.md` | `~/.config/opencode/agents/*.md` |

## Prerequisites

- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jonxlegasa/prompts.git
cd ~/prompts
bash setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` does two things:
1. `bash utils/compose.sh` — copies `src/` prompts into the stow packages
2. `stow --adopt claude opencode` — symlinks the packages into `~`

## Usage

Edit prompts in `src/`, then re-run setup:

```bash
vim src/MISSION.md        # edit the main system prompt
vim src/skills/my-cmd.md  # edit or add a skill
bash setup.sh             # rebuild + redeploy
```

## Project structure

├── .gitignore                  # excludes generated files
└── setup.sh                    # one-command deploy
```

## .gitignore

The generated files inside the stow packages are **not** tracked in git. They are build artifacts created by `compose.sh` from the source files in `src/`. The `.gitignore` excludes:

- `claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — generated from `src/MISSION.md`
- `claude/.claude/commands/` — generated from `src/skills/*.md`
- `opencode/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` — generated from `src/MISSION.md`
- `opencode/.config/opencode/agents/` — generated from `src/skills/*.md`

Only `src/` is the source of truth. On a fresh clone, run `bash setup.sh` to rebuild everything.
